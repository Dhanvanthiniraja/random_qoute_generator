The Random Quote Generator is a simple, interactive web application that displays inspirational quotes at the click of a button. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates core web development fundamentals.

Key Features:

Dynamic Quote Display: Shows randomized quotes from a curated collection with accompanying author attribution
One-Click Interaction: A user-friendly button triggers new quote selection without page reload
Responsive Design: Centered, modern UI with a clean white card layout on a soft blue background
Visual Polish: Includes smooth hover effects on the button and professional typography
Technical Stack:

HTML: Semantic structure with quote and author placeholders
JavaScript: Random selection logic using Math.random() and DOM manipulation
CSS: Flexbox-based centering, card-style layout, rounded corners, and shadow effects
Use Case:
Ideal as an introductory project for learning front-end development or as a motivation tool for daily inspiration. The modular structure allows easy expansion with more quotes, API integration, or sharing functionality.
